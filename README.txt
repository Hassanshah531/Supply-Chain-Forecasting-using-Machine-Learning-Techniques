How can data analytics transform supply chain operations?

Businesses that employ advanced data can better understand their supply chain. Advanced data gives you a broader 
range of in-depth information that you can use to make your processes more effective and your decision making 
more strategic. With advanced data, you can improve your key metrics, get more value from your assets, and keep
your inventory balanced more evenly. Data analytics allows you to see your whole supply chain including its 
strengths, inefficiencies, and pain points. One of the things that is great about advanced data is that it tells
you what's happening in the marketplace. Now you can have the ability to analyze the past, present, and predict
future trends and demands. Being able to supply and demand forecast trends will put you a notch higher than your
competition and will give you a competitive edge. When your supply chain is supported with this information, you
can better control operational costs by producing or storing less when demand for your product is lower or more 
when demand is higher. Data doesn't lie. It removes bias and subjectivity from decision making, allowing you to 
see where your business truly stands.
